# Minesweeper

A recreation of the classic Windows game. Made by me (Madeleine Bour Dehmer) as a fun coding challenge while I was on holiday. I am not affiliated with Microsoft.

I'm aware there's plenty left to implement in order for the game to run smoothly, and I will maybe get to it in due time.

## Roadmap

- Fail-proof the settings, it's currently possible to select more mines than squares on the board.
- Implement mobile-friendly controls

## Nice-to-haves

- More color schemes
- Board animations
